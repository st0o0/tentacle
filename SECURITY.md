# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The latest released image (`ghcr.io/st0o0/tentacle:latest`) receives security
updates. Older tags are not maintained — pin to a `MAJOR.MINOR` tag and update
regularly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** via GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/st0o0/tentacle/security/advisories/new)
(Security → Advisories → *Report a vulnerability*). Do **not** open a public
issue for security problems.

You can expect an initial response within a few days. Once a fix is available it
is released and the advisory is published.

## Scope

tentacle is a single static Go binary running as a Prometheus exporter for
Jellyfin. Vulnerabilities in its Go module dependencies should be reported
upstream; when a fix is available the image is rebuilt against it. The image is
scanned weekly with Trivy and results appear in the repository's Security tab.
