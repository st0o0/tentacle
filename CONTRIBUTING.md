# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in tentacle!

## Development

tentacle is a Go module that builds into a Docker container.

```bash
# tests + vet (Go)
go test ./...
go vet ./...

# lint
golangci-lint run          # golangci-lint v2
docker run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile

# build
docker build -t tentacle:ci .
```

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main` and open a PR — CI (test, lint, build) runs on pull
  requests.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, …); commitlint enforces this and
  release-please derives the version and changelog from them.
- Keep changes focused and add or update tests for any behavior change.
- Go code must pass `go vet` and `golangci-lint`; the `Dockerfile` must pass
  `hadolint`.
